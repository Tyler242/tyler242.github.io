        <h2>What is a Cryptocurrency? (Wikipedia)</h2>
        <p>
          A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary
          data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Individual
          coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized
          database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to
          control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer
          of coin ownership. Cryptocurrencies are generally fiat currencies, as
          they are not backed by or convertible into a commodity. Some crypto
          schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a
          proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In
          return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount
          they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in
          the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other
          such reward mechanisms. <br /><br />Cryptocurrency does not exist in
          physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a
          central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized
          control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a
          cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a
          single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When
          implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works
          through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that
          serves as a public financial transaction database.

        <h2>What is Blockchain Technology? (Wikipedia)</h2>
        <p>
          A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are
          linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a
          cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
          data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves
          that the transaction data existed when the block was published in
          order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about
          the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional
          block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are
          resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the
          data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without
          altering all subsequent blocks. <br /><br />Blockchains are typically
          managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed
          ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate
          and validate new blocks. Although blockchain records are not
          unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered
          secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with
          high Byzantine fault tolerance.
