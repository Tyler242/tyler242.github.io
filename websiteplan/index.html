      <h2>Purpose of Outside Yet Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Worried if you will get rained on while hiking? Concerned that it will
        be too cold to go white water rafting? The purpose of On Demand Weather
        will be to inform its users about the current and future weather
        patterns and how it will affect whatever outdoor activity they may have
        planned. We want our users to feel that they can visit our site to gain
        information about the weather and how it will affect their outdoor
        adventures. Is it a good day to stay in and watch a movie? Or is it just
        right for jumping out of an airplane.

      <h2>Domain Name: outsideyet.com</h2>
      <p>
        I choose this domain name because it reflects the purpose of the website
        and it was available when I found it. The price listed through the
        google domain search was $12/year.
