        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
          It's Mid-October and Bill is starting to think about making sure his
          yard and home are ready for Winter. There hasn't been any snow or
          below 30 degree weather yet, but he knows that it could happen anyday
          now. As he is considering what needs to be done, he realizes that he
          may not be able to have it all finished until the weekend. With this
          in mind he gets online to check the weather to see if he can put off
          the preparation till the weekend.
