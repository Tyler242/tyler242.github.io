          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>
            It's Mid-October and Bill is starting to think about making sure his
            yard and home are ready for Winter. There hasn't been any snow or
            below 30 degree weather yet, but he knows that it could happen
            anyday now. As he is considering what needs to be done, he realizes
            that he may not be able to have it all finished until the weekend.
            With this in mind he gets online to check the weather to see if he
            can put off the preparation till the weekend.

          <h2>Persona 2: Outdoor Enthusiasts</h2>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>
            It will be spring soon, and Mike is really excited about getting out
            to go mountain biking. He is trying to plan a trip nearby with a
            bunch of his friends, but isn't sure if the trails will be dry
            enough next weekend. To find out he pulls out his phone and uses our
            mobile website to take a look at the forecast between now and then
            looking for any signs of snow and rain.
